OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- attributes
        Expectation attributes to be kept by NSI.
        Validate attributes are:
         - `accessIdentifier' (str): AID of the device, i.e. for 6500
        shelf : SHELF-n.
         - `additionalAttributes' (dict): Various miscellaneous
        attributes that do not necessarily belong in the parent
        resource. Attributes are populated dynamically and therefore
        cannot be documented here.
         - `associationState' (str): Association state of the network
        construct.
         - `associationStateLastUpdatedTime' (str): Date at which we
        last changed association state.
         - `associationStateQualifier' (str): How the associationState
        has been set.
         - `associationStateQualifierReason' (str): Reason for going
        into maintenance mode.
         - `capabilitySpecRef' (str): Name of the file which contains
        the constraint rules of the network device.
         - `deviceType' (str): Device Type.
         - `deviceVersion' (str): Device version (e.g. 6500 32-SLOT
        OPTICAL)
         - `endDate' (str): The scheduled end date and time of the
        expectation, with RFC 3339 date-time format
         - `geoLocation' (dict): The geography location of the device
         - `ipAddress' (str): IP address of the network construct.
         - `ipCommunicationDetails' (dict): IP communications data for
        the network construct
         - `l2Data' (list): It represents the L2 Configuration Data on
        the NE.
         - `longName' (str): Extended name of the Network Construct
         - `macAddress' (str): MAC address of the device.
         - `memberFunction' (str): Member function of the network
        construct.
         - `modelType' (str): The model type of network construct,
        TPE, FRE.
         - `name' (str): Name (e.g. TID) of the Network Construct
         - `networkConstructType' (str): The type of network
        construct. It is used to represent the physical hierarchy of a
        network element.
         - `numberOfShelves' (int): Number of shelves (primary +
        member shelves in case of TIDc)
         - `policies' (list): Policies to be applied to the entity.
         - `resourcePartitionInfo' (list): It represents which
        partition the NE belongs to.
         - `resourceType' (str): Resource Type.
         - `serialNumber' (str): Serial number (e.g. NNTMHQDP0001)
         - `shelfType' (str): Shelf type of the network construct.
         - `softwareImage' (str): Software image
         - `softwareType' (str): Software type (e.g. OCP)
         - `softwareVersion' (str): Software version running in the
        device.
         - `srlg' (list): Shared risk link group is used by the path
        computation engine to ensure that the alternate links involved
        in a service do not share the same shared risk link group.
         - `startDate' (str): The scheduled start date and time of the
        expectation, with RFC 3339 date-time format
         - `subnetName' (str): Subnet name (e.g. ROADM1---ROADM2---
        SUBNET)
         - `typeGroup' (str): Resource adapter type group.
